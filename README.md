"# CSI6900" 
Feature_Engineering.ipynb contains the codes for running all the feature selection algorithms 
Overall Analysis Main.ipynb contains an overall analysis of the results of all the datasets combined. 
Dataset Analysis Main.ipnyb displays the performance of RiceVD compared to the other feature selection algorithms, when the datasets are compared by different complexity measures like Imbalance Ratio, Tlcm, N3 and DegOver.  
Comparison between feature algorithms main.ipnyb contains analysis regarding how the different feature selection algorithms are faring up against RiceVD.
Classifier Analysis.ipnyb contains how the performance of RiceVD compares to the others across each learning algorithms.
FeaturesAnalysis.ipnyb and NeighboursAnalysis.ipnyb is part of the ablation study.
